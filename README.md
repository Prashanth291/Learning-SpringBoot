# Learning Spring Boot & Java Backend Development 🚀

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey in **Java backend development** using **Spring Boot**.  
It contains multiple projects, experiments, and practice implementations aimed at building strong fundamentals in **REST APIs, data persistence, and backend architecture**.

---

## 📌 Repository Overview

The repository serves as a **learning workspace** where I explore and practice:

- Spring Boot fundamentals
- RESTful API development
- Spring Data JPA & Hibernate
- Database integration using H2 (and later relational databases)
- Project structuring and best practices in backend development

Each folder represents an **independent learning module or mini-project**.
